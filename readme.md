# Learn Pandas

This repo is just a mini-dump and collection of my sorid attempt to explore pandas.  

Right now I'm not sure what this repo will eventually look like but I imagine I'll group tutorials around directories and will be using ipython jupyter notebooks to learn that platform as well.

## Sub-directories

List of directories and their contents:
- `/gregreda`: Contains notebooks following Greg Reda's excellent [3 part intro to Pandas data structures series](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/)
